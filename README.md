Python version : 3.12.0
Project Overview: Real-Time Ride Management System

Our project aims to create a robust ride management system using Django Rest Framework (DRF). Here are the key features we’ll implement:

User API:
API endpoints for user registration and login.
Handling user authentication securely using tokens.
Enable users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
Creating ride requests.
Viewing ride details.
Listing all rides.

Ride Status Updates:
Created API endpoints to update ride statuses (e.g., started, completed, cancelled).
validation and security checks during status transitions.

Real-Time Ride Tracking :
Simulate real-time ride tracking by periodically updating the ride’s current location.
Use technologies like WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE) for seamless communication.
Ride Matching :
Our system will enhance user experience, streamline ride management, and provide real-time insights for both riders and drivers. 🚗🌐

This project will empower users to efficiently request rides, track their progress, and ensure smooth communication between all stakeholders. Let’s get started!
